# NarrativeNexus – Dynamic AI Text Analysis Platform

## Overview
NarrativeNexus is a Dynamic AI Text Analysis Platform designed to automate the analysis of large volumes of unstructured text.  
The system performs topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and summarization, enabling users to extract meaningful insights efficiently without manual processing.

This project demonstrates the practical application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques through an interactive web-based interface.
