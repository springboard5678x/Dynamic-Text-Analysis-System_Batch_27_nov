## 🏁 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
-   [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
-   [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone --single-branch -b debraj_mistry https://github.com/springboard5678x/Dynamic-Text-Analysis-System_Batch_27_nov
cd Dynamic-Text-Analysis-System_Batch_27_nov
```

### 2. Backend Setup

Setting up the Python environment and installing dependencies.

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    
    # Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    
    # macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
    ```
    The API will be live at `http://localhost:8000`.
    *API Documentation is available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.*

### 3. Frontend Setup

Setting up the Next.js client.

1.  **Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will start on port **9002**.
    
    > **Note:** The default port is configured to `9002` to avoid conflicts.

4.  **Open your browser:**
    Visit [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) to see the app in action!
