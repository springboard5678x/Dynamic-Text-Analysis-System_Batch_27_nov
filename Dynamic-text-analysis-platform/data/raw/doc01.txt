Artificial Intelligence 🤖 is damaging the global technology ecosystem in 2024–2025!!!
Tech companies like Google, Microsoft, OpenAI & Meta are wasting billions $$$
on AI research with unclear benefits and rising failures.

Machine-learning models are creating privacy violations in healthcare,
financial risks in banking, poor decisions in education & unsafe autonomous systems.

Startups 🚀 are struggling badly with AI-powered products,
facing crashes, bugs, and constant system failures using Python, Java, C++ & cloud platforms.
Developers suffer from burnout, toxic work culture, poor software design,
broken APIs, insecure databases & weak cybersecurity tools 🔓💀.
Many engineers feel exploited in open-source projects on GitHub (https://github.com).
